[JavaScript for Automation Cookbook][wiki]
==================================

JavaScript for Automation is a new thing in Mac OS X Yosemite.
It allows you to control applications using JavaScript language. How awesome!

However, [its documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/index.html) covers the basics of using JavaScript to interact with the Open Scripting Architecture.
For many tasks in scripting, there's a lot to figure out, and many different documentations to refer to.

So I created this JavaScript for Automation cookbook that features a lot of examples, such as:

- How to display alert, prompt and confirm dialogs.
- How to run shell scripts.
- How to create a command-line script (shebang script) and read `argv` arguments.

Where it makes sense, I try to link to the official documentation as much as possible so you can dive deeper.

For ease of editing and contribution, the contents are on the [wiki][].
